	When baking a cheesecake, it is important not to over bake it. You only want to bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle, not until it is rock solid. It is important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure even baking of your cheesecake. To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water that goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed.</p>
