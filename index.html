When baking a cheesecake, it is important not to over bake it . You only want to
bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle, not until it is rock solid.</p>
<p> It is important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure even baking of your cheesecake.</p>
<aside>
To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water that goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed.
